Known bugs/problems/incompatibilities:

Nero 5.5.5.3 badly writes Form2 tracks when loading the CUE file on a multiple 
track image. Workaround: create a single track image and load the BIN file
instead of the CUE. This bug has been fixed on recent Nero versions.

Alcohol 120% 1.3.5 has a bug regarding the relative offsets of each track start 
as referenced by the CUE file (it treats 01 indexes as 00 indexes so each track 
starts 2 seconds later!), again only on multiple track mode. Workaround: create 
a single track image.

Form2 files smaller than 300 Kb cannot be burned in multiple track mode. Use
single track mode instead for these.

Wildcards don't work on quoted filenames (such as those containing spaces) due
to a bug in MinGW wildcard expansion.
