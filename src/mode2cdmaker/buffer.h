Usage:

   BufInit: initializes buffer, do always before using it, needs a valid filedescriptor
   BufWriteSeek: seeks to a certain point and flush buffer if needed, always 
    recommended before writing if you plan to do non-sequential writes
   BufRead/BufWrite: read or write data from/to the buffered file
   BufWriteFlush: flush buffered data to the file being written, needed after closing it
   BufFree: free buffer
