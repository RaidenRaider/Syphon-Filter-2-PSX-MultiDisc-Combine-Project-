000: (4 bytes) Signature "FF9 ".
004: (4 bytes) Don't know yet. (Value=0x6)
008: (4 bytes) Number of entries in directory. (Value=0xf)
00C: (4 bytes) Don't know yet. (Value=0x1/2/4/8)


Next follow each directoy entry up to a number equal to the value at offset 0x008.

(4 bytes) - Type. (02=directory; 03=array of files; 04=end of volume) (I think.)
(4 bytes) - Number of files in directory. (Except for type 04. - 00)
(4 bytes) - Pointer to sector with more information about files in directory. (Different meaning for type 04. - ptr to first file)
(4 bytes) - Pointer to first sector of first file. (Except for type 04. - 00)

pad with "FF9 " for rest of 0x800 bytes



Type 02 entries have elements like this:
(4 bytes) - I don't know what they are, but include incrementing numbers and some attributes. (Maybe identifiers.)
(4 bytes) - Pointer to first sector of file.

This means Type 02 entries are like directories, with entries pointing directly to the files.
FFFFFFFF - EOF
(ptr to end of last file)


Type 03 entries are a bit different. I've got only one. Its elements are like this:
(2 bytes) - Number of sectors to add to base sector or 0xffff for empty entries, with "base sector" being the sector pointer that appears in the Type 03 entry.

I see Type 03 entries as an array of pointers to files inside another file. Perhaps a better term would be subdirectory, but then, the structure is not like the others. You pick the names as I'm not very good at that.
I think all files in this entry are the effects you see (hear?) in the battles as there are a lot of images of little stars and thunder.

(pad with 00)

The Type 04 entry effectively indicates there are no more entries. It points to the same sector pointed by the first entry.
